A snapshot called "CoherenceDemoSnapshot" has been recovered into the current cluster.
This operation abandons all existing partitions for the service and loads
data saved using the "Create Snapshot" command.
<p><p>
When you issue a snapshot operation against a service, the service is automatically
suspended before the operation and resumed after the operation. This is to ensure the service
and data is in a consistent state.
<p><p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you have Federation enabled, or enable Federation after recovering a snapshot, you must issue a "Replicate All", to ensure both clusters are
in sync..
<p>
There are a number of ways you can issue Persistence operations against services.
<ol>
    <li>Coherence Query Language (CohQL) - CohQL has commands for all Persistence operations. See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.2206/develop-applications/using-coherence-query-language.html#GUID-6275EDBA-BC8A-4E3F-BDF6-E4ACB958DEE4" target="_blank">
        Coherence Documentation</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>Coherence JVisualVM Plug-in - The plug-in has a "Persistence" tab, which allows you to issue all Persistence operations. See the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.2206/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html#GUID-42C93F83-317C-403A-AD0C-488249E1A56A3" target="_blank">
       Administration Guide</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
       WLST - When using Coherence in a WebLogic Server environment, WLST can be used to issue Persistence commands when connected to the Admin server. See the
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/12213/wls/CLUST/coherence.htm#CLUST-GUID-1188101D-EA18-47B7-AA9A-C4AF186E799A" target="_blank">WebLogic Server Documentation</a> for more information.
    </li>
    <li>
        Via a JMX tool such as JVisualVM or JConsole - Operations can be invoked on the PersistenceCoordinator MBean directly. See
        <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/middleware/standalone/coherence/14.1.1.2206/manage/using-jmx-manage-oracle-coherence.html#GUID-42C93F83-317C-403A-AD0C-488249E1A56A" target="_blank">Coherence Documentation</a>
        for more information.

        Using Java - See the examples shipped with Coherence for examples on how to do this.

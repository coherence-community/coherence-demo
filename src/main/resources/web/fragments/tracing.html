<a target="_blank" href="https://opentracing.io">OpenTracing</a> is a vendor-neutral API for distributed instrumentation and tracing which Coherence has adopted support
for as of version 14.1.1.0.  The OpenTracing feature can be dynamically enabled or disabled at the cluster or member
level using JMX or Management over REST.
<p></p>
OpenTracing will be bootstrapped automatically by Coherence when the appropriate dependencies are on the classpath
(see the Jaeger dependency within the demo's pom.xml).  However, any compatible OpenTracing implementation may be used
as long the library also provides a <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-tracerresolver">TracerResolver<a>
implementation (Jaeger happens to be an implementation that supports this).  Configuration of Jaeger is typically
performed by a series of environment variables (see the documentation <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger-client-java/blob/master/jaeger-core/README.md">here</a>),
which you can see used within the demo code for the Launcher, StartMemberResource, and StartSecondaryResource classes.
<p></p>
In order to capture tracing spans for JAX-RS, see the TracingFilter class.  This filter intercepts in-coming requests
and outbound responses and creates/updates spans for all JAX-RS resources defined in the ServiceResourceConfig class,
however, the TracingFilter class can be used with any JAX-RS resource.
<p></p>
This demo also uses JPA to persist cache entries to an in-memory database in order to show tracing spans
being captured by the demo's use of the the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/opentracing-contrib/java-jdbc/issues">OpenTracing java-jdbc</a>
library which allows tracing of any JDBC driver.  Review the demo's persistence.xml to see how this is enabled.
<p></p>
Review the Utilities class to see how we instrumented existing code to logically group demo operations with any spans
that may be generated by the actions the code takes.
<p></p>
Lastly, navigate to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:16686">http://localhost:16686</a> to see the captured
spans in a visual format via Jaeger UI.  When reviewing spans within the UI, you will be able to see JAX-RS,
Coherence, and JDBC spans along with their metadata and timings.

There are two ways to configure tracing within the demo.  The first, is to use the <em>Configure Tracing</em>
from the main drop down menu which allows configuration of tracing globally or by the member's role within
the cluster (in the case of the demo, we arbitrarily chose odd and even roles).  It's important to remember that while
there is a facility to configure tracing at a cluster level, the change itself is applied the member level, so members
added to the cluster <em>after</em> em a tracing configuration change, will not have the same change applied. Secondly,
you may enable/disable tracing on a per-member basis by using the <em>Actions</em> menu associated with each cluster member.
As you experiment, you will see the dashboard provide feedback on the tracing status of each cluster member.
